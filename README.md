🛍️ Sales Data Analysis Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes a company’s sales performance using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for data cleaning and exploration, and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.

The goal is to identify sales trends, profitable regions, and top-performing products, and to present these insights through an interactive dashboard.

🧠 Objectives

Analyze sales data to find patterns and performance trends.

Visualize KPIs such as Total Sales, Profit Margin, Top Products, and Regional Sales.

Use Python for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

Create a Power BI dashboard for interactive insights.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Power BI: Interactive dashboards & reports
